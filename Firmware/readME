- Use of Energia, CCS and Uniflash 

- 130 meters max @ 1 DSSS ( 18dbm Tx power)
 -estimated value for a 2dbi antenna on both ends and a RX sensitivity of -96 dBm

NOTES: 

Since ease of use was one of the requirements, "Arduino function wise", I decided it was better to use a TI radio tool code that 
provided a large range of configurable RF and power states and that is also configurable as a server, client, AP, and others. 
In order to achieve the required range and low power, the user can change those settings or choose an option that offers a high
transfer rate in exchange for range, in case an OTA update is required.

The Mux tool / Sys configuration tool must be changed accordingly to the board used. Since I am bound to my launchpad hardware 
setup, I needed to use a port configuration different from the PCB developed. Thus the user leds in the PCB will have different
ports from the dev kit used.

Due to lack of time, battery voltage reading not implemented yet.
