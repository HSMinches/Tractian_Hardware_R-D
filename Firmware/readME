- Use of Energia, CCS and Uniflash 

- 130 meters max @ 1 DSSS ( 18dbm Tx power)
 -estimated value for a 2dbi antenna on both ends and a RX sensitivity of -96 dBm

NOTES: 

Since ease of use was one of the requirements, "Arduino function wise", I decided it was better to use a TI radio tool code that 
provided a large range of configurable RF and power states and that is also configurable as a server, client, AP, and others. 
In order to achieve the required range and low power, the user can change those settings or choose an option that offers a high
transfer rate in exchange for range, in case an OTA update is required.

The Mux tool / Sys configuration tool must be changed accordingly to the board used. Since I am bound to my launchpad hardware 
setup, I needed to use a port configuration different from the PCB developed.
